# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Our standards are based on the Contributor Covenant v2.1. All contributors are expected to:

- Be respectful and collaborative.
- Avoid harassment, hate speech, and abusive behavior.
- Signal issues constructively and provide reproducible examples for bugs.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening a private issue or contacting the project maintainers.
